Dylan Jones:
We are doing lab 5 in order to understand extreme programming and test driven
development in a more realistic environment.  By keeping track of our progress
using subversion and a spreadsheet, we are able to see each step of the process
as it works together.  In the spreadsheet, we are able to see how Wake's
Traffic Light metaphor works with test driven development.  Each iteration
includes writing the test case so the code doesn't compile, writing stubs so
the code compiles but the test case fails, and finally writing the
functionality to pass the test case.  Lab 5 demonstrates how this process works
well in software engineering.
